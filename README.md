## Description
  Track your daily workouts. Keep a log of all your daily workouts and record information such as type of workout, date, duration and notes. There is also a pie chart to compare how many of each type of workout you have logged.

## Usage
  After signing up as a new user on the signup page, or logging in on the login page, the user is taken to the home page where they are presented with an `Add Workout` button. After they click on it, they are prompted to enter information about their new workout. A drop down menu offers 3 categories of workouts: Strength/Resistance. Cardio/Aerobics, and Flexibility. Then there is a form to fill in the name of the workout, the date, the duration, and any notes the user may want to add. They then click the `Add Workout` button at the bottom of the form, and they are redirected to the home page, where the new workout is added and is displayed as a list item of all workouts. The name and date of the workout appear with a `View this workout` link underneath. The user is then taken to the Edit Workout page where they can edit or delete the workout. 
  In the navabar at there is a logo that links to the homepage. The `Metrics` button loads the pie graph where the user can see each the overall number of each category of workouts displayed in the graph. If the user hovers over each corresponding color of the chart, they can see the category name and how many times they logged that type of workout. 
  There is also a logout button in the navbar for the user to logout.
